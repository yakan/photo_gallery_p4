In this project, we will create an interactive photo gallery using Javascript and jQuery. Thumbnails and photos will be provided with descriptions. At the top of the page, there will be a search area where photos will hide and show depending on user input. When the user clicks on a thumbnail, the photo will display in a lightbox. There should be a back and previous arrows to cycle through photos.
